# Report Automation Project

A comprehensive Python-based automation suite for generating reports, analyzing data, and creating interactive dashboards.

## 📋 Overview

This project contains various Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts designed to automate report generation and data analysis tasks. It includes tools for:

- Excel data analysis and processing
- Interactive dashboard creation
- Weekly and daily report automation
- Price comparison analysis
- Data visualization and pivot table generation

## 🛠️ Features

- **Dashboard Creation**: Interactive dashboard using Python (`dashboard.py`)
- **Excel Analysis**: Comprehensive Excel file analysis and processing
- **Weekly Reports**: Automated weekly report generation
- **Invoice Processing**: Day-wise and channel-wise invoice report processing
- **Price Comparison**: Automated price comparison analysis
- **Pivot Tables**: Dynamic pivot table generation with slicers
